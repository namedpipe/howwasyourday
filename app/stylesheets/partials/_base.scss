// Here is where you can define your constants for your application and to configure the blueprint framework.
// Feel free to delete these if you want keep the defaults:

$blueprint-grid-columns: 24;
$blueprint-container-size: 950px;
$blueprint-grid-margin: 10px;

// Use this to calculate the width based on the total width.
// Or you can set $blueprint-grid-width to a fixed value and unset $blueprint-container-size -- it will be calculated for you.
$blueprint-grid-width: ($blueprint-container-size + $blueprint-grid-margin) / $blueprint-grid-columns - $blueprint-grid-margin;
