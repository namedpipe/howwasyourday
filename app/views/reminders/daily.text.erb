Hi <%= @user.name %>,

How was your day yesterday?

You didn't rate your day for <%= @missing_date %>. Why don't you go ahead and do that now? The links below let you directly rate your day.

Happy - http://<%= HowWasYourDay::Application.config.host_for_emails %><%= @user.good_rating_link_for(@missing_date) %> 
Mixed - http://<%= HowWasYourDay::Application.config.host_for_emails %><%= @user.mixed_rating_link_for(@missing_date) %> 
Bad - http://<%= HowWasYourDay::Application.config.host_for_emails %><%= @user.bad_rating_link_for(@missing_date) %> 

Thanks for using "How was your day?"!

Sincerely,

Someone Who Cares
