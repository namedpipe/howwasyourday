<p>Hi <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>How was your day yesterday?</p>

<p>You didn't rate your day for <%= @missing_date %>. Why don't you go ahead and do that now? The links below let you directly rate your day.</p>

<p><%= link_to "Good", "http://" + HowWasYourDay::Application.config.host_for_emails + @user.good_rating_link_for(@missing_date) %> <br/>
<%= link_to "Mixed", "http://" + HowWasYourDay::Application.config.host_for_emails + @user.mixed_rating_link_for(@missing_date) %> <br/>
<%= link_to "Bad", "http://" + HowWasYourDay::Application.config.host_for_emails + @user.bad_rating_link_for(@missing_date) %> <br/>
</p>

<p>Thanks for using "How was your day?"!</p>

<p>Sincerely,

Someone Who Cares</p>
